# Authentication and Database Schema Fix

## Issue 1: Missing Password Column in Users Table
We encountered an error during user signup: "Could not find the 'password' column of 'users' in the schema cache". 

This happened because our authentication code in `lib/auth.ts` was trying to store passwords directly in the users table, but our Supabase schema didn't have a password column defined.

## Issue 2: Missing RLS Policy for User Creation
After adding the password column, we encountered a 401 Unauthorized error with the message: "new row violates row-level security policy for table users".

This occurred because we enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on the users table but didn't add an INSERT policy to allow new user creation during signup.

## Issue 3: User ID Not Being Set
After fixing the RLS policy, we encountered a 400 Bad Request error with the message: "null value in column 'id' of relation 'users' violates not-null constraint".

This occurred because our users table requires an ID that references auth.users(id), but we weren't creating a Supabase auth user first.

## Issue 4: Email Domain Validation
We encountered an error: "Email address 'username@nebulachat.app' is invalid".

This occurred because Supabase's auth system validates email addresses and was rejecting our custom domain.

## Issue 5: Existing Users Unable to Log In
After implementing Supabase Auth, we encountered the error: "Invalid login credentials".

This happened because existing users created before the auth integration don't have corresponding auth records.

## Issue 6: Missing Password Column in Rooms Table
We encountered an error when creating rooms: "Could not find the 'password' column of 'rooms' in the schema cache".

This happened because our code was trying to store a password in the rooms table, but our Supabase schema didn't have this column defined.

## Complete Fix Applied
1. Added a `password` column to the `users` table in the setup files
2. Added an INSERT policy for the users table to allow user creation
3. Improved error handling in auth.ts for better debugging
4. Implemented proper Supabase Auth integration:
   - Now creating auth users first using supabase.auth.signUp()
   - Using the generated auth user ID for our users table
   - Properly logging in with supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()
   - Properly logging out with supabase.auth.signOut()
5. Used a valid email domain (gmail.com) to pass Supabase's email validation
6. Added backward compatibility for existing users:
   - Login attempts first try the new auth method
   - If that fails, it falls back to the old direct database check
   - For existing users, it attempts to create a matching auth user for future logins
7. Added a `password` column to the `rooms` table for room access control

## How to Apply This Fix
1. Go to the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the following SQL:
```sql
-- Fix 1: Add password column to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS password TEXT;

-- Fix 2: Add INSERT policy for users table
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create a user account" 
ON users FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Fix 3: Add password column to rooms table
ALTER TABLE rooms ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS password TEXT;
```

3. Update your code to use the latest version of auth.ts

## Individual Fix Scripts
For targeted fixes, you can use these individual scripts:
- `add_rls_policy.sql` - Adds the missing RLS policy for user creation
- `add_room_password_column.sql` - Adds the password column to rooms table

## Important Notes
1. Each username must be unique as we're using it to create email addresses in the format `username@gmail.com`

2. These are not real email addresses - users won't receive actual emails at these addresses

3. Existing users can continue using their accounts, while new users will be properly set up with the enhanced security

4. This implementation now utilizes Supabase's built-in authentication system which:
   - Provides proper JWT token authentication
   - Securely handles passwords (no plaintext storage)
   - Generates secure user IDs

5. For full production-readiness, consider further enhancements:
   - Implement real email verification
   - Add password reset functionality
   - Add profile management
